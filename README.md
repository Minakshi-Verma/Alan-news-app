### Voice_enabled Alan-news-app

Alan news app is voice enabled smart news app that gives you latest news around you just using voice commands. You can find news from your favorite news source ( like, CNN, Wired, BBC News, Time, IGN, Buzzfeed, ABC News...) based on several different categories(like, business, entertainment, health, science, sports, general, technology...) or search terms(like, Bitcoin, PlayStation 5, Smartphones, Donald Trump...). The news are fetched from trusted https://newsapi.org/. To make this app more fun, we have integrated everyday coversation script as well.
